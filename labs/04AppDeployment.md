# Application Deployment 

In this chapter, you will deploy the classic guestbook sample Kubernetes application. You will be mostly following the steps from https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/ with some modifications. You will employ these modifications to show additional concepts, such as ConfigMaps, that are not present in the original sample.

The sample guestbook application is a simple, multi-tier web application. The different tiers in this application will have multiple instances. This is beneficial for both high availability and scalability. The guestbook's front end is a stateless application because the front end doesn't store any state. The Redis cluster in the back end is stateful as it stores all the guestbook entries.

## Overview

An application consists of multiple parts, and you will build the applications one step at a time while the conceptual model behind them is explained. You will be able to easily adapt the steps in this chapter to deploy any other application on AKS.

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers. Three fundamental concepts in Kubernetes are Deployments, ReplicaSets, and Pods. These components are essential for managing and orchestrating containerized applications effectively.


![Alt text](../media/15.png)

[**Pods**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) \
...are the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object, a Pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Think of a Pod as a logical host for one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage.

Each Pod contains one or more containers (e.g., Docker containers) that share storage, network, and a specification for how to run the containers. Pods are the atomic units that Kubernetes manages.

[**ReplicaSets**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) \
A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at any given time. Itâ€™s the key to ensuring your application has the correct number of instances running.

Replicasets maintains the desired number of Pods by creating or deleting them as needed. If a Pod fails or is terminated, the ReplicaSet automatically creates a new Pod to replace it, ensuring high availability and reliability.

Imagine you have a web application that needs to handle a certain amount of traffic. A ReplicaSet can ensure that the right number of instances (Pods) are always running to handle the load.

[**Deployments**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) \
A Deployment provides declarative updates to Pods and ReplicaSets. It manages the deployment of applications by creating ReplicaSets to ensure that the correct number of Pods are running.

Deployments handle the lifecycle of an application, including rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling. You can use Deployments to upgrade your application seamlessly without downtime by gradually replacing old Pods with new ones.

For instance, if you need to update your web application to a new version, a Deployment can handle this smoothly by creating a new ReplicaSet and transitioning from the old version to the new one.

**Relationships** \
*Pods are managed by ReplicaSets:* A ReplicaSet ensures that the desired number of Pods are running. It monitors the health of Pods and replaces them if they fail.
Deployments manage ReplicaSets: A Deployment creates and manages ReplicaSets to ensure that the correct number of Pods are running. It simplifies the process of updating and scaling applications by abstracting the underlying ReplicaSets.
Rolling Updates Example
*Deployment:* Initiates the rolling update process.
*Old ReplicaSet:* Gradually phased out as the new ReplicaSet is scaled up.
*New ReplicaSet:* Created and scaled up to take over from the old one.
*Pods:* Transition from the old ReplicaSet to the new one, ensuring zero downtime.
This architecture ensures that your application remains available and reliable while updates are applied without interruption.


## Introducing the Application 

The application stores and displays guestbook entries. You can use it to record the opinion of all the people who visit your hotel or restaurant, for example.

Below figure shows you a high-level overview of the application. The application uses PHP as a front end. The front end will be deployed using multiple replicas. The application uses Redis for its data storage. Redis is an in-memory key-value database. Redis is most often used as a cache.


![Alt text](../media/16.png)

We will begin deploying this application by deploying the Redis master.

## Deploying the Redis master
Download 04redis-master-deployment.yaml from under code...

```sh
kubectl apply -f 04redis-master-deployment.yaml.yaml
```

```yaml
1   apiVersion: apps/v1
2   kind: Deployment
3   metadata:
4     name: redis-master
5     labels:
6       app: redis
7   spec:
8     selector:
9       matchLabels:
10        app: redis
11        role: master
12        tier: backend
13    replicas: 1
14    template:
15      metadata:
16        labels:
17          app: redis
18          role: master
19          tier: backend
20      spec:
21        containers:
22        - name: master
23          image: k8s.gcr.io/redis:e2e
24          resources:
25            requests:
26              cpu: 100m
27              memory: 100Mi
28            limits:
29              cpu: 250m
30              memory: 1024Mi
31          ports:
32          - containerPort: 6379
```
Let's dive deeper into the code line by line to understand the provided parameters:

Line 2: This states that we are creating a deployment. As explained in Chapter 1, Introduction to containers and Kubernetes, a deployment is a wrapper around pods that makes it easy to update and scale pods.

Lines 4-6: Here, the deployment is given a name, which is redis-master.

Lines 7-12: These lines let us specify the containers that this deployment will manage. In this example, the deployment will select and manage all containers for which labels match (app: redis, role: master, and tier: backend). The preceding label exactly matches the labels provided in lines 14-19.

Line 13: This line tells Kubernetes that we need exactly one copy of the running Redis master. This is a key aspect of the declarative nature of Kubernetes. You provide a description of the containers your applications need to run (in this case, only one replica of the Redis master), and Kubernetes takes care of it.

Lines 14-19: These lines add labels to the running instance so that it can be grouped and connected to other pods. We will discuss them later to see how they are used.

Line 22: This line gives the single container in the pod a name, which is master. In the case of a multi-container pod, each container in a pod requires a unique name.

Line 23: This line indicates the container image that will be run. In this case, it is the redis image tagged with e2e (the latest Redis image that successfully passed its end-to-end [e2e] tests).

Lines 24-30: These lines set the CPU/memory resources requested for the container. A request in Kubernetes is a reservation of resources that cannot be used by other pods. If those resources are not available in the cluster, the pod will not start. In this case, the request is 0.1 CPU, which is equal to 100m and is also often referred to as 100 millicores. The memory requested is 100Mi, or 104,857,600 bytes, which is equal to ~105 MB. CPU and memory limits are set in a similar way. Limits are caps on what a container can use. If your pod hits the CPU limit, it'll get throttled, whereas if it hits the memory limits, it'll get restarted. Setting requests and limits is a best practice in Kubernetes. For more info, refer to Kubernetes Documentation.

Lines 31-32: These two lines indicate that the container is going to listen on port 6379.

The Kubernetes YAML definition is similar to the arguments given to Docker to run a particular container image. If you had to run this manually, you would define this example in the following way:

**Run a container named master, listening on port 6379, with 100M memory and 100m CPU using the redis:e2e image.**

```sh
docker run --name master -p 6379:6379 -m 100M -c 100m -d k8s.gcr.io/redis:e2e
```
In this section, you have deployed the Redis master and learned about the syntax of the YAML file that was used to create this deployment. In the next section, you will examine the deployment and learn about the different elements that were created.

## Examining the deployment

The redis-master deployment should be complete by now. Continue in the Azure Cloud Shell that you opened in the previous section and type the following:

```sh
kubectl get all
```

You should get an output similar to the one displayed below. In your case, the name of the pod and the ReplicaSet might contain different IDs at the end of the name. If you do not see a pod, a deployment, and a ReplicaSet, please run the code as explained in step 4 in the previous section again.

![Alt text](../media/17.png)

You can see that you created a deployment named redis-master. It controls a ReplicaSet named redis-master-fb489cc66. On further examination, you will also find that the ReplicaSet is controlling a pod, redis-master-fb489cc66-wt279. 

More details can be obtained by executing the "kubectl describe <object> <instance-name>" command, as follows:

```sh
kubectl describe deployment/redis-master
```


## Exposing the Redis master service

**Kubernetes Service:**

A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. Services enable communication between different parts of your application and with external users, providing stable endpoints and load balancing for Pods.

**Why Services are Required:**

1. **Stable Networking:** Pods in Kubernetes are ephemeral; they can be created and destroyed dynamically, leading to changes in their IP addresses. Services provide a stable IP address and DNS name, ensuring that clients can reliably connect to the Pods, regardless of their individual IP addresses.

2. **Load Balancing:** Services automatically distribute traffic across the set of Pods they are targeting. This load balancing ensures efficient use of resources and high availability of the application.

3. **Service Discovery:** Kubernetes Services offer built-in service discovery mechanisms. Applications can discover and connect to other services using their DNS names, simplifying the configuration and integration of microservices.

4. **Decoupling Components:** By using Services, different components of an application can be decoupled. Each component can communicate with others through well-defined interfaces, making it easier to scale, manage, and update individual parts without affecting the entire system.

5. **External Access:** Services can expose your applications to external users. For example, a Service of type `LoadBalancer` can provision an external IP address, enabling access from outside the Kubernetes cluster.

**Types of Services:**

1. **ClusterIP:** The default type, which exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster. This type makes the Service only accessible within the cluster.

2. **NodePort:** Exposes the Service on the same port of each selected Node in the cluster, making it accessible from outside the cluster using `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.

3. **LoadBalancer:** Creates an external load balancer (if supported by the cloud provider) and assigns a fixed external IP to the Service, making it accessible from outside the cluster.

4. **ExternalName:** Maps a Service to the contents of the `externalName` field (e.g., `example.com`), returning a CNAME record with the name.



**Example Usage:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
  type: ClusterIP

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis-master
  labels:
    app: redis
    role: master
    tier: backend
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 6379
    targetPort: 6379
  selector:
    app: redis
    role: master
    tier: backend
```

Deploy the manifest file with ...

```
kubectl apply -f redis-master-service.yaml
```

The redis-master-service.yaml file has the following content:

1   apiVersion: v1

2   kind: Service

3   metadata:

4     name: redis-master

5     labels:

6       app: redis

7       role: master

8       tier: backend

9   spec:

10   ports:

11   - port: 6379

12     targetPort: 6379

13    selector:

14      app: redis

15      role: master

16      tier: backend

Let's now see what you have created using the preceding code:

Lines 1-8: These lines tell Kubernetes that we want a service called redis-master, which has the same labels as our redis-master server pod.

Lines 10-12: These lines indicate that the service should handle traffic arriving at port 6379 and forward it to port 6379 of the pods that match the selector defined between lines 13 and 16.

Lines 13-16: These lines are used to find the pods to which the incoming traffic needs to be sent. So, any pod with labels matching (app: redis, role: master and tier: backend) is expected to handle port 6379 traffic. If you look back at the previous example, those are the exact labels we applied to that deployment.

![Alt text](../media/21.png)

You see that a new service, named redis-master, has been created. It has a Cluster-IP of 10.0.145.51 (in your case, the IP will likely be different). Note that this IP will work only within the cluster (hence the ClusterIP type).

A service also introduces a Domain Name Server (DNS) name for that service. The DNS name is of the form <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local; in this case, it would be redis-master.default.svc.cluster.local. To see this in action, we'll do a name resolution on ourÂ redis-master pod. The default image doesn't have nslookup installed, so we'll bypass that by running a ping command. Don't worry if that traffic doesn't return; this is because you didn't expose ping on your service, only the redis port. The command is, however, useful to see the full DNS name and the name resolution work. Let's have a look:

```
kubectl get pods

#note the name of your redis-master pod

kubectl exec -it redis-master-<pod-id> -- bash

ping redis-master
```

This should output the resulting name resolution, showing you the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of your service and the IP address that showed up earlier. You can stop the ping command from running by pressing Ctrl+C. You can exit the pod via the exit command, as shown below...

![Alt text](../media/22.png)

In this section, you exposed the Redis master using a service. This ensures that even if a pod moves to a different host, it can be reached through the service's IP address. In the next section, you will deploy the Redis replicas, which help to handle more read traffic.

## Deploying the Redis replicas
Running a single back end on the cloud is not recommended. You can configure Redis in a leader-follower (master-slave) setup. This means that you can have a master that will serve write traffic and multiple replicas that can handle read traffic. It is useful for handling increased read traffic and high availability.

Let's set this up:

Create the deployment by running the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f redis-replica-deployment.yaml
```
Let's check all the resources that have been created now:
```
kubectl get all
```
The output would be as shown below...


![Alt text](../media/23.png)


Based on the preceding output, you can see that you created two replicas of the redis-replica pods. This can be confirmed by examining the redis-replica- deployment.yaml file:
1   apiVersion: apps/v1
2   kind: Deployment
3   metadata:
4     name: redis-replica
5     labels:
6       app: redis
7   spec:
8     selector:
9       matchLabels:
10       app: redis
11       role: replica
12       tier: backend
13   replicas: 2
14   template:
15     metadata:
16       labels:
17         app: redis
18         role: replica
19         tier: backend
20     spec:
21       containers:
22       - name: replica
23         image: gcr.io/google-samples/gb-redis-follower:v1 24         resources:
25           requests:
26             cpu: 100m
27             memory: 100Mi
28         env:
29         - name: GET_HOSTS_FROM
30           value: dns
31         ports:
32         - containerPort: 6379
Everything is the same except for the following:
Line 13: The number of replicas is 2.
Line 23: You are now using a specific replica (follower) image.
Lines 29-30: Setting GET_HOSTS_FROM to dns. This is a setting that specifies that Redis should get the hostname of the master using DNS.
As you can see, this is similar to the Redis master you created earlier.
Like the master service, you need to expose the replica service by running the following:
```
kubectl apply -f redis-replica-service.yaml
```
The only difference between this service and the redis-master service is that this service proxies traffic to pods that have the role:replica label.
Check the redis-replica service by running the following command:
```
kubectl get service
```

![Alt text](../media/25.png)

You now have a Redis cluster up and running, with a single master and two replicas. In the next section, you will deploy and expose the front end.


## Deploying and exposing the front end

Up to now, you have focused on the Redis back end. Now you are ready to deploy the front end. This will add a graphical web page to your application that you'll be able to interact with.

You can create the front end using the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f 04frontend-deployment.yaml
```

To verify the deployment, run this command:
```
kubectl get pods
```
This will display the output shown in Figure 3.13:

![Alt text](../media/26.png)

You will notice that this deployment specifies 3 replicas. The deployment has the usual aspects with minor changes, as shown in the following code:

1  apiVersion: apps/v1

2   kind: Deployment

3   metadata:

4     name: frontend

5     labels:

6       app: guestbook

7   spec:

8     selector:

9       matchLabels:

10        app: guestbook

11        tier: frontend

12    replicas: 3

13    template:

14      metadata:

15        labels:

16          app: guestbook

17          tier: frontend

18      spec:

19        containers:

20        - name: php-redis

21          image: gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend:v4

22          resources:

23            requests:

24              cpu: 100m

25              memory: 100Mi

26          env:

27          - name: GET_HOSTS_FROM

28            value: env

29          - name: REDIS_SLAVE_SERVICE_HOST

30            value: redis-replica

31          ports:

32          - containerPort: 80

Let's see these changes:

Line 11: The replica count is set to 3.

Line 8-10 and 14-16: The labels are set to app: guestbook and tier: frontend.

Line 20: gb-frontend:v4 is used as the image.
You have now created the front-end deployment. You now need to expose it as a service.

## Exposing the front-end service 

There are multiple ways to define a Kubernetes service. The two Redis services we created were of the type ClusterIP. This means they are exposed on an IP that is reachable only from the cluster.

![Alt text](../media/27.png)

Another type of service is the type NodePort. A service of type NodePort is accessible from outside the cluster, by connecting to the IP of a node and the specified port.

![Alt text](../media/28.png)

A final type â€“ which will be used in this example â€“ is the LoadBalancer type. This will create an Azure Load Balancer that will get a public IP that you can use to connect to.

![Alt text](../media/29.png)

The following code will help you to understand how the frontend service is exposed:

1   apiVersion: v1

2   kind: Service

3   metadata:

4     name: frontend

5     labels:

6       app: guestbook

7       tier: frontend

8   spec:

9     type: LoadBalancer # line uncommented

10    ports:

11    - port: 80

12    selector:

13      app: guestbook

14      tier: frontend

This definition is similar to the services you created earlier, except that in line 9 you defined type: Load Balancer. This will create a service of that type, which will cause AKS to add rules to the Azure load balancer.

Now that you have seen how a front-end service is exposed, let's make the guestbook application ready for use with the following steps:

To create the service, run the following command:
```
kubectl create -f frontend-service.yaml
```
This step takes some time to execute when you run it for the first time. In the background, Azure must perform a couple of actions to make it seamless. It has to create an Azure load balancer and a public IP and set the port-forwarding rules to forward traffic on port 80 to internal ports of the cluster.
Run the following until there is a value in the EXTERNAL-IP column:

```
kubectl get service -w
```

![Alt text](../media/30.png)

Confirm the configuration in the portal as below...
![Alt text](../media/31.png)

![Alt text](../media/32.png)

## The guestbook application in action

Type the public IP of the service in your favorite browser. 

![Alt text](../media/33.png)

Go ahead and record your messages. They will be saved. Open another browser and type the same IP; you will see all the messages you typed.

# Congratulations â€“ you have completed your first fully deployed, multi-tier, cloud-native Kubernetes application!
