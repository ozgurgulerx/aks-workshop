# Application Deployment 

In this chapter, you will deploy two applications on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). An application consists of multiple parts, and you will build the applications one step at a time while the conceptual model behind them is explained. You will be able to easily adapt the steps in this chapter to deploy any other application on AKS.
