# Application Deployment 

In this chapter, you will deploy two applications on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). An application consists of multiple parts, and you will build the applications one step at a time while the conceptual model behind them is explained. You will be able to easily adapt the steps in this chapter to deploy any other application on AKS.

## Overview
Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers. Three fundamental concepts in Kubernetes are Deployments, ReplicaSets, and Pods. These components are essential for managing and orchestrating containerized applications effectively.

[**Pods**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) \
...are the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object, a Pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Think of a Pod as a logical host for one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage.

Each Pod contains one or more containers (e.g., Docker containers) that share storage, network, and a specification for how to run the containers. Pods are the atomic units that Kubernetes manages.

[**ReplicaSets**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) \
A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at any given time. Itâ€™s the key to ensuring your application has the correct number of instances running.

Replicasets maintains the desired number of Pods by creating or deleting them as needed. If a Pod fails or is terminated, the ReplicaSet automatically creates a new Pod to replace it, ensuring high availability and reliability.

Imagine you have a web application that needs to handle a certain amount of traffic. A ReplicaSet can ensure that the right number of instances (Pods) are always running to handle the load.

[**Deployments**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) \
A Deployment provides declarative updates to Pods and ReplicaSets. It manages the deployment of applications by creating ReplicaSets to ensure that the correct number of Pods are running.

Deployments handle the lifecycle of an application, including rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling. You can use Deployments to upgrade your application seamlessly without downtime by gradually replacing old Pods with new ones.

For instance, if you need to update your web application to a new version, a Deployment can handle this smoothly by creating a new ReplicaSet and transitioning from the old version to the new one.

**Relationships** \
*Pods are managed by ReplicaSets:* A ReplicaSet ensures that the desired number of Pods are running. It monitors the health of Pods and replaces them if they fail.
Deployments manage ReplicaSets: A Deployment creates and manages ReplicaSets to ensure that the correct number of Pods are running. It simplifies the process of updating and scaling applications by abstracting the underlying ReplicaSets.
Rolling Updates Example
*Deployment:* Initiates the rolling update process.
*Old ReplicaSet:* Gradually phased out as the new ReplicaSet is scaled up.
*New ReplicaSet:* Created and scaled up to take over from the old one.
*Pods:* Transition from the old ReplicaSet to the new one, ensuring zero downtime.
This architecture ensures that your application remains available and reliable while updates are applied without interruption.
